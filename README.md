Tools for peer correcting.

Not finished yet :
------------------

This is an early release of the PHP version to help cloning during the 42 PHP pool.
The options are all fully fonctionnal (at least for the tests I've done), please report me the bugs if found.

Usage :
-------

This tool requires your access to intra.42.fr and dashboard.42.fr.

At first use, you will be invited to enter your credentials (your real 42 credentials). If you want to, your credentials can be saved to a file for easy further usage.

Options :
---------

- Clone remaining corrections : clones all your remaining corrections
- Clean corrections folder (make fclean) : does "make fclean" in all subdirectories of your corrections folder
- Remove .git folders : removes all .git folder in all subdirectories of your corrections folder

Suggestions / Bugs :
--------------------

For suggestions or bug reports, you can contact me on jabber (jlejeune), or send me an email (jlejeune@student.42.fr).

I love coffee too. O_O
